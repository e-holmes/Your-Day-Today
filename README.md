App Title: Your Day Today!™️

Description: Presenting a dashboard of daily data, Your Day Today!™️ provides data to a user for everything they need involving today. This includes current time, local weather, New York Times news, and fun facts on this exact day in history! The app also provides the ability to generate a to-do list, add your own custom fun fact for the day, or add a future day countdown from today for "big day" events like an upcoming birthday or anniversary.

Getting Started: Open up the app and register an email to log in. Proceed to your dashboard and review the information. Weather and time information can be seen first, including a graph of temperature changes over time. Next is a to-do list where you can add your daily to-do's, or one time to-do's. After that is a cool facts section with random facts about today's date throughout history. As the user you are also able to submit and add your own custom fact about today! Lastly, populated at the bottom is news retrieved from today's New York Times articles to fill your need for news.
